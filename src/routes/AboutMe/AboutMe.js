                    <p className='text2'>When Iâ€™m not coding you can find me serving at my local church, on the golf course attempting to shave off a few strokes, fishing, playing piano, or on the couch with my wife watching a movie. I love to learn and grow, taking everything I do to the next level including my skill in code. I bring excitement and dedication in anything I put my hands to. My lifelong dream is to raise a family with my wife and see our kids have children of their own.</p>
